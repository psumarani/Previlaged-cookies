# Privileged-Cookies
This project documents how I identified and exploited a cookie-based authorization flaw in a web application. The system relied on client-side cookie data to control user roles, which allowed privilege escalation by modifying the role value.
This challenge demonstrated how improper access control and trusting client-side data can lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

🔐 Key Concepts:
• Cookie Manipulation
• Privilege Escalation
• Improper Access Control
• Importance of Server-Side Validation

Every challenge solved sharpens the attacker mindset — and strengthens the defender within.
